# The purpose of a MANIFEST.in file is to tell Python packaging tools (like setuptools) which non-code files (such as data, configs, docs, etc.) should be included in your source distribution (sdist).
# By default, only Python files are included; MANIFEST.in lets you add extra files or folders needed for your package to work correctly.
