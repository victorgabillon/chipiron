The files in this directory are supposed to follow the structured defined by the dataclass class 'PlayerArgs' define (recursively) in the file factory.py in chipiron.players (careful, the location might be change in future versions, in that case please update this readme)

Note: chess search-dynamics copy-stack optimization is now configured in
`implementation_args.search_dynamics_addon` (script-level config), not in player
`main_move_selector.anemone_args.search.*` blocks.
